## User Stories

I have to create some user stories from the project specifications in order to do this technical assesment, you can see my mental process and the user stories on the [next guide: Tasks](/TASKS.md)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

To create a production build you should run the following scripts:

First create the production build with:
```bash

```
Then next run the production server with: 

```bash
npm start
